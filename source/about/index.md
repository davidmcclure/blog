title: About
---

I'm a software engineer, interactive designer, and (aspiring) digital artist in San Francisco. Before moving to the west coast, I spent three wonderful years at the [Scholars Lab](http://www.scholarslab.org), where I was the lead developer of [Neatline](http://neatline.org), a geospatial content management system and map-making framework that makes it easy to tell stories on maps. I'm also interested in literary theory, philosophy, electronic literature, and information retrieval.

I answer email at [davidwilliammcclure@gmail.com](mailto:davidwilliammcclure@gmail.com) and tweet at [@clured](https://twitter.com/clured). All of my code is on Github at [davidmcclure](https://github.com/davidmcclure) and [scholarslab](https://github.com/organizations/scholarslab).
